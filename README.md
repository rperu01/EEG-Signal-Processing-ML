# EEG-Signal-Processing-ML
EEG-based ML project focused on detecting mental arithmetic tasks from noisy physiological signals. Preprocessed EEG data using band-pass filtering and FFT, extracted frequency-domain features (beta band power, statistics), and trained an SVM classifier, achieving 61% accuracy on a public dataset.
